<h3> Please Note </h3>
<p>To make the images look like a scan, we are currently trying a new feature that crops automatically the pictures to only keep the letter. As this feature is experimental, it might
    result in some incorrect results. If this should happen, may we please
    ask you to retry submitting a picture of your letter? This feature works
    best when the background is  dark and the borders of the letter are
    visible.</p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause.</p>
